Q5. What are different implementations of Python ? Which implementation we are using ?


Python has several implementations, each with its own unique characteristics and intended use cases. Some of the most notable 
implementations of Python include:

1. CPython: This is the reference implementation of Python, written in C. CPython is the most widely used implementation and is the 
default interpreter that most users interact with. It's known for its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with the Python 
language specification.

2. Jython: Jython is an implementation of Python that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It allows Python code to seamlessly 
interact with Java code and libraries, making it suitable for integrating Python into Java-based applications.

3. IronPython: IronPython is an implementation of Python that runs on the .NET Framework. It provides interoperability with other 
.NET languages and allows Python code to interact with .NET libraries and components.

4. PyPy: PyPy is an alternative implementation of Python that aims to improve performance through just-in-time (JIT) compilation. 
It's written in Python itself and includes a JIT compiler that can significantly speed up execution compared to CPython for certain 
workloads.

5. MicroPython: MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of Python that is optimized for microcontrollers and embedded 
systems. It's designed to run on resource-constrained devices and provides a subset of the Python language tailored for such 
environments.

6. Stackless Python: Stackless Python is an enhanced version of CPython that provides support for microthreads (called tasklets) 
and lightweight concurrency. It allows for highly concurrent and parallel programming without the overhead of traditional threading.

The implementation typically used by most Python developers and users is CPython, as it's the default and most widely supported 
implementation. However, depending on specific requirements and use cases, developers may choose to use alternative implementations 
such as Jython, IronPython, PyPy, or others. Each implementation has its strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different 
scenarios.
